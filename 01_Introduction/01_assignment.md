# 01 Introduction Assignment

## Background
You have just been enlisted in the global academy for space exploration. You are enrolled in the engineering department, and as such must demonstrate a working knowledge of software engineering. This assignment, should you choose to accept it, will test your basic knowledge of how to document, write, and run code in the Python language.

Failure to pass this assignment will mean as delay in your dream of being the Cheif Engineering Officer of the fleet's most prized vessel USS Explorer McSpaceFace.

## Goal
This assignment is to prove that you have a basic understanding of the following
1. How to write single line comments
2. How to write multi line comments
3. How to print something to the console

## Requirements
- Must write a program from scratch
- Program must include at least one single line comment
- Progam must include at least one multi-line comment
- Program must print at least one word

## Prerequisits
- Make sure you are on your local branch(`git checkout <your_branch_name>`)
- Make sure your local branch is up-to-date( `git pull` ) and that your branch is clean (nothing staged or waiting when you run `git status` )
  - To do this you can simply run `git stash && git pull` in your command line. But make sure you are in the correct branch, and that you don't have any work that you need to save first.

## Submitting your assignment
